* Nomenclature

** Group

- /Closure/ :: If =x= and =y= are two elements in a group, =G=, then `x . y` is also in =G=.
- /Associativity/ :: If =x=, =y= and =z= are in group =G=, then =x . (y . z) = (x . y) . z=
- /Invertibility/ :: For every =x= in =G=, there exists some =y= in =G=, such that; =x . y = y . x=
- /Identity/ :: For any element =x= in =G=, there exists an element =I= in =G=, such that: =x . I = I . x=, where =I= is called the identity element of =G=.

** Abelian Group

- Group with commutativity.

** Field

- "[A] field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do."

** Ring

- "[R]ings are algebraic structures that generalize fields: multiplication need not be commutative and multiplicative inverses need not exist."

* What The Hell Is This

- =G = (Z/nZ)âˆ—=
- On the other hand for elliptic curves no subexponential algorithm is known for the DLP :: Is this the definition of an "elliptic curve"? or a property?
- "Jacobians of curves of small genus"
- abstract cohomology theories and classical results from explicit class field theory are used for efficient implementations to count points on hyperelliptic curves :: /only/ hyperelliptic curves?
