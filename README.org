*** Group

A group satisfies the axioms...

- /Closure/ :: If $x$ and $y$ are two elements in a group, $G$, then $x . y$ is also in $G$.
- /Associativity/ :: If $x$, $y$ and $z$ are in group $G$, then $x . (y . z) = (x . y) . z$
- /Invertibility/ :: For every $x$ in $G$, there exists some $y$ in $G$, such that; $x . y = y . x$
- /Identity/ :: For any element $x$ in $G$, there exists an element $I$ in $G$, such that: $x . I = I . x$, where $I$ is called the identity element of $G$.

Axiomatical corollaries and properties that groups can have...

- The unit of a group is unique [wait, are unit and identity always interchangeable...?]
- The inverse of an element x, denoted by $x^{âˆ’1}$, is unique
- If abelian, the inverse of x is usually denoted by âˆ’x
- A group $G$ is cyclic if there is $x âˆˆ G$ such that $\langle x \rangle = G$
- Every subgroup of a cyclic group G is also cyclic.
- If $G$ is cyclic and of order $n$, then for each divisor $d$ of $n$, $G$ contains exactly one cyclic subgroup of order $d$.

**** Subgroup

Let $G$ be a group. A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a subset of $G$ containing the unit element $e$ and such that
- for all $x,y âˆˆ H$ one has xy âˆˆ H
- if $x âˆˆ H$ then also $x^{âˆ’1} âˆˆ H$.

 tl;dr -- A subgroup is exactly what it sounds like: A group formed by some elements of a larger group.

[[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LagrangesGroupTheorem.html][Lagrange Theorem]]

Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$. As a consequence, the order of every element [in $H$?] also divides the order of $G$.

**** Abelian Group

 - Group with commutativity.

**** Equivalence classes and left/right cosets

Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

For all $x, y âˆˆ G$, the relation $xâˆ¼y âˆˆ H$, if and only if $x^{âˆ’1}y âˆˆ H$ and $x âˆ¼ y$ if and only if $yx^{âˆ’1} âˆˆ H$, is an equivalence relation.

An equivalence class for this relation is denoted by $xH = \{xh | h âˆˆ H\}$, respectively $Hx = \{hx | h âˆˆ H\}$ and are called respectively left and right /cosets/ of $H$. The numbers of classes for both relations are the same. This invariant is called the "index of $H$ in $G$" and is denoted by $[G : H]$.

**** Cayley's Theorem

Every group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group $Sym(G)$ whose elements are the permutations of the underlying set of $G$

*** Field

 - "[A] field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do."

*** Ring

 - "[R]ings are algebraic structures that generalize fields: multiplication need not be commutative and multiplicative inverses need not exist."

*** Discrete logarithm [problem]

 "[I]n any group $G$, powers $b**k$ can be defined for all integers $k$, and the discrete logarithm $log_ba$ is an integer $k$ such that $b^k = a$"

 The **problem** is that it's hard to find a $k$ given only $b$ and $a$.

 In the book's notation we want a $k$ such that $[k]P = Q$, where $P$ is the generator (a point chosen on the curve that forms a group). $P$ is fundamental to the chosen curve's finite field. $Q$ is your "public key" and $k$ is your "private key" (probably wrong <---)

*** Isomorphism

Given two groups $(G,*)$ and $(H,âŠ™)$, a group isomorphism from $(G,âˆ—)$ to $(H,âŠ™)$ is a bijective group homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. Spelled out, this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function $f:G\to H$ such that for all $u$ and $v$ in $G$ it holds that

$f(u*v)=f(u)\odot f(v)$

The two groups $(G,âˆ—)$ and $(H,âŠ™)$ are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other. This is written:

$(G,âˆ—)â‰…(H,âŠ™)$

** Short Definitions

- decision problem :: is statement about input true or false. "Is this number prime?"
- computation problem :: do a computation for me. "What is the result of one divided by zero?"
- associative :: $(xy)z = x(yz)$
- commutative :: $xy = yx$
- transitive :: $x = y$ and $y = z$ $\implies x = z$
- image :: For a subset $R$ of $S$ the /image/ of $f(R)$ is the set of all $f(r)$ where $r âˆˆ R$.
- $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ::
  As best "we" can tell: This is "integers that are multiples of $n$". If $n$ is five, then it means $[0, 5, 10, ...]$
  _Or is it_ "the cyclic group of order $n$"? aka $[0, 1, 2, ...n-1]$ ...?
- $\langle x \rangle$ :: the set $\{x^n | n âˆˆ \mathbb{Z}\}$

"One can formulate a computation problem from a decision problem." Really?

* What The Hell Is This

- "On the other hand for elliptic curves no subexponential algorithm is known for the DLP" --> Is this the definition of an "elliptic curve"? or a property?
- "Jacobians of curves of small genus"
- "abstract cohomology theories and classical results from explicit class field theory are used for efficient implementations to count points on hyperelliptic curves" --> /only/ hyperelliptic curves?
- Are there "points outside of a (EC) group that lead you /into/ a group?" -- the more I learn the more I wonder if the question makes sense. $[k]P$ is in the group /by definition/. So in that way there is no "starting outside the group". But what about starting with a different generator? can $[j]Q = [k]K$ for some $[j]Q$ that is outside of the group? err, grumble.
- What's with this affine/projection stuff on P271?
- "Common notations for the image of (x, y) under this mapping are x Ã— y..." --> I am thrown by "image". That's not the same as "members x and y" wat? image? [We now think we know what "image" means and define it above ðŸ‘†]
- "The **group G is said to be** commutative or **abelian**, if the composition law is commutative. As previously mentioned, **the law is often denoted by + or âŠ• and the unit element by 0 in this case.**" --> wwhaaat? -- Are + and âŠ• interchangeable and /have nothing to do with/ commutativity? Is 0 the unit element /in the case/ of abelian groups? (only? yes but also?) -- questions about notation.
- "Definition 2.6 Let $G$ be a group. An element $x âˆˆ G$ is of finite order if $\langle x \rangle$ is finite." --> Can there be infinite-order groups that have $x$ of finite order? And we are saying the /element/ is of finite order, yes?
